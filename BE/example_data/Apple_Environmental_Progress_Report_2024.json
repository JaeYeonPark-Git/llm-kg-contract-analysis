        "text": "# **Apple's commitment to climate action has never been more clear.**\n\nThanks to the hard work of teams across our company, we've reduced our emissions by over 55 percent since 2015. We've crossed key milestones on our environmental journey. And we're rising to the generational challenge of climate change by working with companies and communities that span the globe.\n\nApple 2030 is our commitment to be carbon neutral for our entire footprint by the end of the decade. We'll get there by innovating at every stage of the product lifecycle — from how they're made, to what they're made from.\n\nThat starts with bringing new clean energy online across our supply chain. Today, more than 320 suppliers have committed to using renewable electricity for Apple production. With over 16 gigawatts already online, they're avoiding more than 18 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nOur teams and suppliers are a part of so many communities, so Apple's work to protect the planet takes us around the world. That's why we're partnering directly with communities and local organizations to support environmental solutions where they're needed most. In 2023, that meant expanding our Power for Impact program to bring clean energy to underserved communities in Nepal and Colombia, and supporting programs that increase access to safe water and sanitation in India.\n\nWe're also building our products with more recycled and renewable material than ever — work that helps to drive down our carbon footprint. Our customers play an important role in this effort. When you participate in the Apple Trade-In program, you're helping to bring us closer to the day our products will be made without taking anything from the Earth.\n\nThe proof is in our products. Last year, more than 20 percent of the materials we shipped in Apple products came from recycled sources. MacBook Air is our first product made with more than 50 percent recycled material, and we're making important strides across all of our products. The iPhone 15 lineup, Apple Watch Series 9, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 use 100 percent recycled cobalt in their batteries. More than 99 percent of the tungsten in our products comes from recycled sources. And we're driving innovation around the world to improve the way our industry recycles and recovers materials.\n\nWe're also finding new and better ways to get Apple products into people's hands. It's not just trains, planes, and automobiles increasingly, we're shipping Apple products on the open seas, because ocean freight can reduce emissions by as much as 95 percent compared to air transport. And we continue to restore our planet's ecosystems — like the Atlantic Forest, which stretches from Brazil to Paraguay — that play a key role in removing carbon from the atmosphere.\n\nWhat does all this work add up to? Progress. And that progress is sorely needed, because the impacts of climate change are all around us. Its frontlines are not in boardrooms or government buildings they're in communities. And we owe it to our global community to rise to the challenge of climate change with all the innovation, empathy, and commitment we can muster.\n\n",

Achieving carbon neutrality for our entire carbon footprint requires a transition to 100 percent clean energy and significant energy reductions throughout our supplier facilities.\n\nWe launched the Supplier Clean Energy Program in 2015 to advance renewable energy throughout our manufacturing supply chain. As of March 2024, more than 320 global suppliers — representing 95 percent of Apple's direct manufacturing spend — have joined the program. These suppliers have committed to using 100 percent renewable electricity for all their Apple production by the end of this decade. The success of this initiative has led to the next phase of our efforts toward achieving a carbon neutral supply chain by 2030.\n\nTo rapidly scale and accelerate the progress of the Supplier Clean Energy Program, Apple updated the Supplier Code of Conduct to require all direct suppliers to transition to renewable energy in the manufacturing of Apple products. The codification of this requirement is the next step in our decarbonization journey and a sign of our commitment to integrate supply chain decarbonization into our core business decisionmaking. We hope that our approach can serve as a model that other companies can follow.\n\nWe're also working to address emissions from product use through investments in renewable energy so that every watt of electricity associated with our customers' product use is matched by clean electricity. We're prioritizing product efficiency to reduce the electricity use of our products.\n\nWe've also introduced Grid Forecast, a tool in the Home app that informs U.S.-based users when their power grid has cleaner energy available for use. And with iOS 16, we launched the Clean Energy Charging feature in the United States, which looks at the sources of the electricity during expected charge times and optimizes for when the grid is using cleaner energy sources like solar or wind.\n\n",

And we announced that, by 2025, we plan to use 100 percent recycled cobalt in all Apple-designed batteries, 100 percent recycled tin soldering, 100 percent recycled gold plating in all Appledesigned rigid and flexible printed circuit boards, and 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets across new products[.18](#page-111-0)\n\nWe've pioneered the use of many recycled materials in our products through world-class product engineering, extensive design qualifications, and supply chain engagement. Our focus is on materials that will yield significant environmental and social\n\nimpacts, even when those materials come with notable challenges to building circular supply chains. To read more about our efforts to create circular supply chains, see the [Prioritizing our efforts](#page-16-0) section. We intentionally design products to minimize the use of primary (non-recycled) materials and maximize recycled content as feasible. And year over year, we innovate and improve manufacturing processes to use materials more efficiently and decrease manufacturing scrap.\n\nIn 2023, manufacturing our products accounted for 59 percent of our gross carbon footprint. This includes emissions from fuel combustion; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC); refrigeration; use of fluorinated gases; and other physical or chemical processes (excluding transportation). These emissions sources vary widely and require use of diverse technologies and solutions to abate.\n\nOur approach is to identify process emissions across our supply chain, like the use of fluorinated gases in display and semiconductor manufacturing, and launch targeted programs to address these emissions in partnership with our suppliers, governments, and industry stakeholders. We continue to launch supplier programs targeting emissions from manufacturing operations and facilities used to produce Apple products, like the Supplier Energy Efficiency Program launched in 2015 to help our suppliers optimize their energy use.\n\n",

Shipping the same Apple product by ocean generates 95 percent fewer emissions than shipping it by air, based on our carbon footprint methodology. We're investigating a transition to low-carbon sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to reduce the carbon footprint of air shipment. We're also addressing transportation-related emissions through product and packaging design that drives reduced packaging mass and volume, creating boxes that use space more efficiently.\n\n",

We underpin our climate strategy with strong business principles and innovation while harnessing the power of markets to replicate our solutions at scale — aiming to create the impact necessary to meet global reduction targets. We're also working to accelerate the global transition toward decarbonization while exploring the next generation of solutions and advocating for stronger policies. These efforts include fostering new and strengthened collaborations in public and private partnerships and investing in technological advancements. We've issued \\$4.7 billion in green bonds to model how businesses can drive investments to reduce global emissions.\n\nClear principles guide this work. Our emissions reduction targets are aligned with what current climate science shows is necessary to help limit warming to 1.5° C. We calculate our footprint across our value chain to include both direct and productrelated emissions — from sourcing materials through end of life. We use the results of our detailed carbon accounting to adjust our Apple 2030 roadmap, which lays out our plan to become carbon neutral. And we're committed to disclosing our carbon footprint as well as our climate strategy and progress. This means sharing both challenges and successes. Our annual Environmental Progress Report, as well as our response to the global disclosure nonprofit CDP, provide details on our progress.\n\nTransparency and disclosure are essential not only for sharing our climate strategy and progress but also for sending clear signals and inviting others to work with us. And progress needs to include low-income and historically marginalized communities that too often bear the brunt of climate change. We're pursuing ways to directly support these communities in our climate programs.

Our strategy is to transition to materials that are manufactured using low-carbon energy and recycled content. We've prioritized the materials and components that make up a large part of our product carbon footprint to move us closer to our goal of carbon neutrality. And to accelerate collective efforts, we signed on as a founding member of First Movers Coalition's near-zero emissions primary aluminum commitment for 2030 (see more on [page](#page-69-0) 70).\n\nOur use of aluminum exemplifies Apple's comprehensive approach: We're transitioning to recycled content, and where we haven't yet, we're moving to low-carbon suppliers and exploring technological innovations to decarbonize — like ELYSIS aluminum, which was smelted without generating greenhouse gas emissions (see [page 33\\)](#page-32-0). We've continued to introduce 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosures of Apple products: Mac Studio now uses 100 percent recycled aluminum in its enclosure — joining Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch SE, iPad, MacBook Air, Mac mini, the Siri Remote, and MacBook Pro. In addition, the new iMac contains 100 percent recycled aluminum in the stand. And with iPhone 15, we've increased recycled content by using 75 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure.\n\nWe're addressing carbon impact by how we source recycled aluminum, too. Our first priority is to recover any of our own scrap at high quality. Then, we look to other postindustrial and postconsumer sources for high-quality recycled aluminum because recycled aluminum manufacturing emits less carbon than newly mined materials. These emissions reduction efforts have reduced our aluminum-related emissions by 68 percent since 2015 and now represent less than 9 percent of our product manufacturing footprint, compared with 27 percent in 2015.\n\nIn 2023, we expanded our use of certified recycled cobalt, steel, gold, and aluminum — materials that typically have significant carbon footprints. We introduced 100 percent certified recycled cobalt for the first time in the battery of Apple Watch and iPhone[.27](#page-111-0) And we increased the content of certified recycled gold across all product lines from 4 percent in 2022 to approximately 25 percent in 2023. This includes everything from the gold plating on multiple printed circuit boards to new applications such as the USB-C connector on iPhone 15.\n\n**TRANSITIONING TO RECYCLED CONTENT**\n\n",

By 2025, we plan to:\n\n- Use 100 percent recycled cobalt in all Apple-designed batteries.[29](#page-111-0)\n- Use 100 percent recycled tin soldering and 100 percent recycled gold plating in all Appledesigned rigid and flexible printed circuit boards[.30](#page-111-0)\n- Use 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets across all products[.31](#page-111-0)\n\nOur efforts focus on 15 materials that we've prioritized based on a broad range of environmental, social, and supply chain impacts. (These are outlined in detail in our [Material Impact Profiles](https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Material_Impact_Profiles_April2019.pdf) white paper[.32](#page-111-0)) Some of the materials prioritized through this process include lower-mass but higher-impact materials like gold. Our priority materials include aluminum, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, paper, plastics, rare earth elements, steel, tantalum, tin, titanium, tungsten, and zinc, and they account for 87 percent of the total product mass shipped to our customers in 2023.\n\nMaintaining our standards for recycled and renewable materials is essential to our journey to create a circular supply chain. Our Recycled and Renewable Material Specification sets requirements based on international standards for recycled content and responsible resource management. By requiring certification to these standards, we're able to confirm that a material has been recycled or comes from a renewable source — one that can continually produce without depleting the earth's natural resources. We approach materials from new sources with the same rigor, evaluating each one for the safety of the materials' chemistry. This process allows us to scale our use of materials that are better for the environment and safer for use in our products. Recycled material is certified by third parties to a recycled content standard that conforms with ISO 14021. Total recycled content numbers also include supplier reported recycled content checked by Apple but not third-party certified.\n\nOur teams are overcoming obstacles to creating closed loop supply chains, including material performance and traceability. This is possible through our work with a diverse group of partners. For example, we were able to design an alloy containing 100 percent recycled aluminum that meets our rigorous design performance standards. And we've improved our ability to track key materials within our supply chain.\n\nBarriers to our progress remain — including challenges within our control and those outside our direct influence. Addressing these requires a collective response. Through collaboration within the material space, we can achieve impact felt beyond our business. The supply chains we're helping create serve more than just our product needs — they help promote the availability of competitively priced, quality recycled and renewable materials across geographies.\n\n",

In 2023, 100 percent of the identified tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold (3TG), cobalt, and lithium smelters and refiners in Apple's supply chain completed assessments to verify compliance with our standards.\n\nWe work with third-party audit programs at an industry-wide level to identify environmental and social, and governance risks at the smelter, refiner, and mining levels. We map other materials in our products — such as mica, copper, graphite, and nickel — and, before production, evaluate suppliers of new materials for compliance with our requirements. We also map, conduct additional due diligence, and facilitate third-party audits on other materials used in our products, such as graphite, nickel, and copper. As we build supply chains for recycled materials, we partner with the smelters and refiners that are able to meet and maintain our standards.\n\n",

        "text": "# **Improving material and manufacturing efficiency**\n\nMaking our manufacturing processes more efficient creates less waste and helps us make the most of the materials that we source. We're also designing our products and packaging so that they require less material in the first place, helping reduce emissions from transporting and processing materials.\n\nFor example, in 2023, we redesigned all packaging for Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch SE models to introduce a new compact design that allows for 25 percent or more devices per shipment. And as we progress toward our 2030 carbon neutrality goal, we're investigating new materials and new ways to manufacture efficiently.\n\nWe've prioritized improving the carbon footprint of the integrated circuits that we use in our products as they're carbon intensive. We've also continued our work with the sustainable semiconductor technologies and systems research program of imec, a world-leading research and innovation hub in nanoelectronics and digital technologies. We have two goals in this collaboration: to improve the carbon footprint models associated with leading nodes of integrated circuit production, and to use these models to identify carbon reduction opportunities for the entire integrated circuits industry.\n\nWe're also exploring opportunities for improved efficiency across our product manufacturing processes. In 2023, we continued to invest in research and development projects aimed at creating less waste in processing materials, reducing machining time and associated energy use, more efficiently transforming material into near-net shapes, and maximizing the recovery and reprocessing of manufacturing scrap. Once these improved processes are successfully developed, we plan to work with our suppliers as they deploy them at scale at their facilities.\n\nApple is committed to setting strict standards for responsible sourcing of the materials used in our products.

We approach this challenge in the earliest phases of design, taking a holistic view of each product from how efficiently the software operates to the power requirements of individual components.\n\nWith each generation of products, we strive to improve energy efficiency. For example, the transition to Apple silicon on Mac devices continues to drive these improvements, including:\n\n- Our pro chips released in 2023 enabled more Mac devices to run with improved energy efficiency. Mac mini with M2 made progress in reducing energy use in 2023.\n- And Apple TV 4K is designed to minimize its impact on the environment, using nearly 30 percent less power than the previous generation while achieving more powerful performance.[43](#page-111-0)\n- The efficiency gains of the A15 Bionic chip eliminate the need for an internal fan, resulting in a more compact design and contributing to a 25 percent reduction in carbon footprint over the previous generation.\n\nWe've cut overall product energy use across all major product lines by more than 70 percent since 2008.[44](#page-111-0) And Apple products are consistently rated by ENERGY STAR, which sets specifications that reflect the 25 percent most energy-efficient devices on the market. In 2023, all eligible Apple products continued to receive an ENERGY STAR rating for superior energy efficiency[.45](#page-111-0) And in 2023, all eligible Apple products met requirements for EPEAT registration, another environmental rating system for electronic products that considers energy efficiency and a number of other environmental topics[.46](#page-111-0)\n\n",

We've replaced each with fiber-based alternatives and implemented innovative alternatives to the small uses of plastics across our packaging — like labels and lamination. At the same time, we're taking steps to ensure that our packaging is recyclable and that the fiber we source comes from recycled sources or responsibly managed forests.\n\nIn 2023, we accomplished the following:\n\n- Released multiple product lineups with over 95 percent fiber-based packaging, including iPhone 15, Mac, iPad Pro, Watch, and Beats.[52](#page-112-0)\n- Released our first 100 percent fiber-based packaging in our fall Apple Watch lineup.\n- Shipped Apple Vision Pro with 100 percent fiber-based packaging in 2024.\n\nWe've also continued our work to address the remaining plastic in the smaller parts of our packaging, like labels and lamination, with the packaging innovations focused on printing directly on boxes and using overprint varnish. This year, we've expanded our efforts to include MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Mac Studio, Mac Pro, and Mac mini.\n\nIn 2022, we introduced these innovations for iPhone, iMac, iPad, and Apple Watch. That same year, we also introduced digital printing directly on the back of boxes for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro to eliminate the need for labels[.53](#page-112-0) We did this by developing a custom high-resolution printer that can print on demand at manufacturing facilities where our products are packaged.

This change will enable us to avoid waste generated by re-packaging goods in new 100 percent fiberbased packaging.\n- † Responsible sourcing of fiber is defined in [Apple's Responsible Fiber Specification \\(PDF\\)](https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Sustainable_Fiber_Specification_April2016.pdf).\n\n<span id=\"page-22-0\"></span>Apple's packaging design guidelines factor in packaging recyclability, requiring the use of fiberbased materials that can break down to pulp as part of mixed-paper recycling streams, alongside materials like cereal boxes[.54](#page-112-0) We test our packaging to standards developed by independent industry and research organizations — including Western Michigan University, the U.S. Forest Service's Forest Products Laboratory, and the Confederation of European Paper Industries — and we continue to monitor evolving international packaging standards.\n\nAs we continue to reduce plastic in our packaging, we make sure that our wood, bamboo, and bagasse fibers are certified by standards such as FSC, PEFC, and Bonsucro. And since 2017, all the wood fiber used in our packaging comes from either certified recycled sources or responsibly managed forests. Through partnerships with The Conservation Fund and World Wildlife Fund, we've protected, and improved forest management practices on, more than one million acres of working forests in the U.S. and China. In 2023, these forests generated enough responsibly sourced fiber to balance all the virgin fiber in our packaging while contributing to the global supply of responsibly sourced fiber.[55](#page-112-0)\n\nImage /page/22/Figure/4 description: {\n\"image\\_description\": \"The image illustrates an Apple Watch packaging designed for sustainability, utilizing 100% fiber-based materials with a commitment to achieving a plastic-free packaging by 2025.

We assess natural gas and electricity usage at each of these site types — as well as research and development facilities — auditing how we perform and using best practices for energy management to reduce our loads. And we design our new buildings around occupants' and lab users' specific needs, enabling us to use our facilities efficiently and productively.\n\n**Existing buildings:** We have significant opportunities to save energy in retrocommissioning buildings that Apple already occupies or operates, including energy-intensive facilities like data centers. We audit the performance of buildings around the world, then deploy energy efficiency measures. Retrocommissioning focuses on building controls to optimize energy use and operational efficiency. We're prioritizing reducing natural gas usage and replacing natural gas equipment with electrical. We're focused on reviewing and benchmarking our most natural gas–intensive buildings to look for reduction and fuel switching opportunities.\n\n**Data centers:** Data centers are traditionally energy intensive, requiring significant resources to cool heat-generating servers and IT equipment. That's why we're continuously monitoring and improving the controls for our cooling systems. This retrospective view often enables us to increase the cooling capacity of our existing facilities, thereby maximizing the number of servers within our data center footprint.\n\nIn 2023, we continued to see energy savings at data centers. A proprietary server design we deployed in 2021 that focused on energy and computing efficiency resulted in an additional 36 million kilowatt-hours per year in energy savings.\n\n**New facilities:** When designing new facilities, or renovating existing facilities, we evaluate each major system to ensure we're managing our energy footprint. We select LED fixtures and install sensors and photocells to reduce light levels based on occupancy and the level of natural daylight. We install high efficiency heating and cooling systems and transformers to reduce energy consumption from our plug loads. We take special attention to ensure we're designing safe, productive spaces, while still prioritizing energy savings. We also prioritize efficient compressed dry air systems and variable air volume fume hoods for our R&D spaces.\n\n**Retail stores:** We continue to prioritize energy efficiency and develop comprehensive energy models for stores so that we can ensure our design is aligned with our energy efficiency targets. We've also decarbonized even further by phasing out natural gas so that we're not reliant on fossil fuels.\n\n**Measurement and accountability:** Measurement is critical to maintaining building energy performance. We have a well-developed system of energy tracking and benchmarking, which includes data from utility meters that continuously monitor 15-minute electricity and daily natural gas energy consumption. This method helps us identify opportunities for performance improvement. This early knowledge enables us to restore building system efficiencies and actively manage our energy footprint.\n\nIn 2023, our energy efficiency program avoided 41 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, which includes savings from the efficient servers, and 100,500 therms of natural gas through adjustments made to 6.7 million square feet of new and existing buildings[.56](#page-112-0) Together, these recent initiatives will avoid an additional 27,000 metric tons of CO2e per year. Combined with ongoing energy savings from past years, and accounting for effective useful lifetime of legacy savings, we saved over 75,000 metric tons of CO2e in 2023.[57](#page-112-0)\n\nImage /page/24/Picture/12 description: {\n\"image\\_description\": \"A photograph of a server room in Apple's Reno data center, depicting rows of server racks organized neatly and a person walking in the background carrying equipment, highlighting the facility's management and layout.\"\n}\n\nApple's Reno data center, opened in 2012, takes advantage of the mild climate by cooling its servers with outside air whenever possible.\n\n<span id=\"page-25-0\"></span>The manufacturing of Apple products accounts for 59 percent of our gross carbon footprint. To address this impact, we collaborate closely with our suppliers to prioritize energy reductions. Together, we work to use clean energy as efficiently as possible at every point in our supply chain, supporting the creation of more efficient factories all over the world. The Supplier Energy Efficiency Program, launched in 2015, helps our suppliers optimize their energy use. Implementing energy efficiencies reduces the energy intensity of manufacturing, which translates to reduced greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWe provide technical and planning support to suppliers as they build more energy-efficient systems. We support our suppliers by helping them recognize optimization opportunities and identify solutions through energy assessments. To assist with implementation, we connect suppliers to extensive education and training opportunities including technical assistance resources — and help them access external funding for energy efficiency projects.\n\nOur suppliers have successfully implemented a range of energy efficiency projects, from installing light sensors and implementing free cooling systems to making boiler and HVAC system energy improvements.\n\nWe launched the Asia Green Fund in 2019 to help provide technical expertise and finance capitalintensive energy efficiency projects. As green financing mechanisms remain integral to the Supplier Energy Efficiency Program, we're exploring new approaches that connect suppliers to external funding for energy efficiency projects while scaling the program and accelerating reductions.\n\nIn 2023, more than 100 supplier facilities participated in our energy efficiency program, achieving more than 2 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity savings and more than 2,200,000 MMBtu in additional energy savings. Together, we estimate that this avoided nearly 1.7 million metric tons of CO2e, representing a 25 percent increase since 2022.\n\n",

Long-standing energy policies and infrastructure that incentivize the use of fossil fuels like coal can make it difficult to bring new renewable energy online in certain regions. In some cases, our suppliers are prompted to rely\n\non less impactful interim solutions, like one-time purchases of energy attribute certificates from existing renewable energy projects. These options represent an annual cost for buyers and often offer little opportunity for cost savings or a return on investment. To overcome these challenges, suppliers are using new purchasing methods, creating renewable energy businesses, and even participating in some of the world's largest and most innovative renewable energy deals. Suppliers are also adapting to changing renewable energy markets by finding new solutions, including first-of-their-kind procurement structures in geographies that are introducing more corporate procurement options.\n\nIn China, this includes the Green Power Trading program, which allows cross-provincial agreements that provide suppliers with more options. South Korea has expanded its options for green power, including power purchase agreements and the ability to purchase renewable energy certificates. Japan has also introduced new renewable energy options, including virtual and physical power purchase agreements and price-competitive nonfossil certificates that have the potential to scale access to renewable energy across the market.

But carbon-intensive energy sources, like coal and gas, often have a price advantage because of subsidies and the ignored costs of externalities, such as greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAcross the regions where our suppliers operate, we engage with policymakers to support renewable energy that's cost-effective, accessible to companies, and sourced from high-quality projects with a material impact on local markets.\n\nFor example, we're encouraging governments not to subsidize or expand carbon-intensive infrastructure. We also encourage them to keep pace with the speed of technological innovation, consider the life cycle emissions of energy solutions, and support new energy solutions that effectively reduce global emissions. Additionally, Apple supports government\n\nefforts in beneficial electrification and the build-out of necessary transmission infrastructure, all while considering cost-effectiveness.

We recently expanded our support by providing funding for phase II of the project.\n\n**Democratic Republic of the Congo:** Apple provides access to renewable energy for the Malaika School, which empowers Congolese girls and their communities through education, agriculture, water projects, health outreach, sports, and vocational training. To support Malaika students and teachers, this solar initiative builds on other Apple collaborations, including virtual Today at Apple sessions on coding with Swift, photography, filmmaking, and design, as well as other events with Apple Retail teams and Diversity Network Associations.\n\n**Israel:** Apple supports the Nitzana Educational Eco-Village — a community for underserved youth — with a 260 kilowatt solar system to help lower electricity costs. The savings help enhance educational experiences for youth from various backgrounds. Apple also supported the expansion with another 64 kilowatt solar system installed in February 2023.\n\n**Nepal:** Apple funded a solar and battery storage system at a nonprofit hospital that serves children throughout Nepal. This system will offer limited backup power during grid outages.\n\n**Nigeria:** Apple helped fund a remote minigrid project that provides energy access to community members and replaces fossil fuels for some businesses. In addition, Apple also funds a solar power system to provide power to public healthcare centers in the state of Ondo, with excess energy serving households in the surrounding region.\n\n**Philippines:** Apple helped fund a new rooftop solar installation at an educational institution in Bataan. This helps reduce electricity cost for the institution and free up funds for scholarships to highachieving, under-resourced students.\n\n**South Africa:** Apple's first PFI project in South Africa helped bring electricity to over 3,500 households that previously lacked access to local street lighting. In addition, Apple will help fund two more projects in South Africa at schools for children with disabilities. Along with five other operational projects across South Africa, these installations will reduce electricity costs, and the savings help fund operating costs and expand programs to support underserved groups.\n\n**Thailand:** Apple helped establish a solar energy system to replace polluting diesel fuel for a remote fishing village that relies on refrigerators to maintain the quality of its fish products. We increased local renewable energy production and battery storage to improve reliable access to electricity.\n\n**Vietnam:** Apple's work to support a program in Vietnam will provide solar electricity for 20 schools around the country, with aspirations to help showcase renewables and sustainable development. At five schools, solar energy systems have been installed and are operational. **Zambia:** Apple will help fund a microgrid and battery storage system to provide power for hundreds of households that are currently without electricity. The project will reduce reliance and costs associated with imported diesel and gasoline for generators, and it will increase the amount of power available to community organizations and businesses.\n\nImage /page/30/Picture/17 description: {\n\"image\\_description\": \"A worker is on a ladder installing electrical connections on a solar power installation, with a background view of rooftops in a community below and a clear blue sky.\"\n}\n\nPower for Impact is expanding access to clean, affordable power in different parts of the world.

In addition to their climate benefits, naturebased solutions offer multiple co-benefits, including enhanced employment and local livelihoods, improved biodiversity, soil carbon and nutrient cycling, and increased timber supply that can reduce the pressure on primary forests.\n\nThe IPCC lays out a range of options to remove carbon from the atmosphere using a combination of photosynthesis and chemistry. These approaches include existing climate solutions, such as afforestation and reforestation, and relatively new\n\ntechnologies, such as direct air capture (DAC) and ocean alkalinization. Apple looked at how these approaches could help balance our residual emissions as we focus on the global urgency to align with a 1.5° C pathway to scale up carbon removal.\n\nFive key criteria drive our exploration:\n\n- **• Stage of development:** A solution's stage of development is important both to meet our Apple 2030 target and to reach scale within the time frame needed to stay within a 1.5° C trajectory.\n- **• Scalability:** We consider scalability because the climate crisis is a collective responsibility, and the impact of Apple's solutions should scale beyond our own environmental footprint.\n- **• Durability:** Removals must be permanent, or if there's a risk of reversal, measures must be in place to address those risks and compensate for any reversals for a defined period of time.\n- **• Carbon methodology:** The impacts achieved need to be accounted for through using a rigorous carbon accounting methodology that aligns with quality and consistency of our own carbon accounting systems, including evaluating any uncertainty in the underlying science.\n- **• Co-benefits:** We evaluated the co-benefits across different carbon removal technologies. Most carbon removal approaches have the potential to generate additional benefits for biodiversity and communities but can also pose risks.\n\nOur review of different available technologies helped us determine that nature-based solutions — including afforestation, reforestation, and revegetation (ARR) and soil carbon sequestration — currently offer the most comprehensive carbon removal approach.\n\n",

Since its creation, the fund has invested in three initiatives that are projected to remove over a million metric tons of carbon starting in 2025. This fund is unique because it aims to change carbon removal from a cost to a potentially profitable investment. By creating a fund that generates both a financial return as well as real and measurable carbon impact, we strive to drive broader change — encouraging capital investment in carbon removal around the globe. We developed the Restore Fund as a pilot, and we're now seeking to expand and improve it so that others can build on our work and scale the market for nature-based removals.\n\nThe first phase of the fund focused on blending responsible forestry practices with carbon removal and sought to maximize environmental impact, including carbon, hydrology, and habitat restoration.\n\nImage /page/35/Picture/19 description: {\n\"image\\_description\": \"A lush green landscape of forests extending as far as the horizon under a bright sky with sparse clouds, showcasing nature's vitality and beauty.\"\n}\n\nAs we focus on eliminating the majority of emissions across the value chain, we're also addressing emissions we can't reduce by looking for high-quality carbon credits from nature-based projects.\n\nBased on our learnings with these projects and the growing global need for more nature-based solutions, Apple announced an expansion of the Restore Fund in 2023. The commitment aims to develop an investment vehicle to scale nature-based solutions using a different kind of financial innovation. This unique blended-fund structure is intended to achieve financial and climate benefits for investors while advancing a new model for carbon removal that addresses a broader spectrum of global potential for nature-based solutions.\n\nThe expanded fund targets two types of investments: regenerative agriculture and other ecosystem assets, and a pipeline of landscape restoration projects that aim to remove carbon from the atmosphere.\n\nIn October 2022, Apple announced three new projects through the Restore Fund and we've invested with three high-quality forestry managers in Brazil and Paraguay. Our most recent project, announced in March 2024, supports the restoration of South America's Atlantic Forest.\n\nAlso in March 2024, Apple welcomed key manufacturing partners Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Murata Manufacturing as new investors in the Restore Fund. Global semiconductor foundry TSMC will invest up to \\$50 million in a fund managed by\n\nClimate Asset Management, a joint venture of HSBC Asset Management and Pollination. Murata — an electronic components supplier for Apple based in Japan — will invest up to \\$30 million in the same fund. These new investments build on Apple's previous commitment of up to \\$200 million for the Restore Fund's second phase, bringing the total to \\$280 million in committed capital.\n\nTSMC and Murata are among the more than 320 suppliers in Apple's Supplier Clean Energy Program. The fund TSMC and Murata are investing in alongside Apple will pool sustainably managed agriculture projects with ecosystem conservation and restoration projects to generate both carbon and financial benefits.\n\nTo improve the accuracy of monitoring and reporting, and verifying the projects' carbon removal impact, Apple is deploying innovative remote sensing technologies using Space Intelligence's CarbonMapper and HabitatMapper and Upstream Tech's Lens. Using high-resolution satellite imagery from Maxar and other providers, this initiative enables us to view detailed habitat and forest carbon maps for our Restore Fund projects. Through our engagement with the MIT Climate & Sustainability Consortium, Apple is jointly funding research with PepsiCo and Cargill to improve the measurement of soil carbon in nature-based carbon removal projects. Apple and\n\npartners have used innovative tools including LiDAR on iPhone, satellite data, bio-acoustic monitoring, and machine learning to evaluate the well-being of the land and project progress.\n\nIntegrity and a rigorous approach are central to how we designed the Restore Fund with our partners. The projects aim to become certified to international standards developed by organizations such as Verra; Gold Standard; the Climate, Community & Biodiversity Alliance (CCBA); and the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Using these international standards helps confirm that the carbon stored in forests is measured and reported to high standards and that projects have the most up-to-date safeguards in place. The projects we choose also seek to have a positive impact on the livelihoods of local communities by bringing economic opportunities to often underserved rural economies. And we'll continue to focus on projects that protect lands with high conservation values.\n\n",

This means sourcing responsibly, minimizing our freshwater use, and eliminating waste across Apple-owned and supplier sites. We work to reduce the overall resource footprint supporting our products by collaborating with suppliers, NGOs, recyclers, community stakeholders, and innovation leaders. We know that we can't do this work alone — it requires broader engagement through collaborations enabling the stewardship of shared resources.\n\nBuilding durable, long-lasting products is central to our approach, making the best use of the resources required to create them. We aim to one day make our products solely from responsibly sourced recycled and renewable materials — while maintaining our same rigorous standards of quality and durability. Innovations and new approaches to recycling will make this possible. We're able to recover and use the materials that we rely on in our products in even greater quantity, helping us begin to realize the full potential of each resource.\n\nWater is one of our most critical resources. Because it's also a community resource, we prioritize our stewardship efforts: working toward the most efficient use of freshwater, using alternatives where possible, and managing our discharge responsibly. We also look beyond our facilities to the water basins where we operate. We're working to improve the quality of the water that our communities rely on through collaborations with local partners — including companies, NGOs, and government agencies.\n\nWe also conserve resources by working to eliminate waste. We work to reuse and recycle across our operations and throughout our supply chain. We aim to eliminate waste where we and our suppliers operate. These efforts include reducing the overall amount of waste that we generate, innovating reuse approaches, and creating new recycling opportunities with local businesses.\n\n",

Engineers in our Reliability Testing Lab assess our designs against our strict durability standards that measure the performance of materials, components, and fully assembled products. They use testing methods that mimic realistic conditions in which our customers use their products, assessing many aspects of each device. To understand how our customers push their products, in-depth user studies are constantly being performed. The results are then used to further define durability standards of our products.\n\nDuring product development, we test numerous units of a product, relying on the results to inform each successive round of design. In 2023 Apple launched Apple Watch Ultra 2, with a design developed for a high level of durability to support the needs of our most adventurous and explorative customers. Apple Watch Ultra 2 was designed for demanding conditions that required a series of new environmental and impact tests to maintain the device's high level of reliability. Tests that our engineering team developed supported compliance with MIL-STD-810H — a standard used for military equipment that's also popular among rugged device manufacturers[.66](#page-112-0) This also included low-pressure testing to simulate a range of environmental conditions, such as high altitude, extreme temperatures, temperature shock, chemical exposure, freezing and thawing, shock, vibration, submersion, and other assessments to emulate operations in rugged settings.

For example, the cost of back glass repair for iPhone 15 Pro is reduced by more than 60 percent compared to iPhone 14 Pro.[67](#page-112-0) The aluminum housing and back glass are no longer one enclosure, so repairs to the back glass don't require replacing the housing.\n- The 13-inch MacBook Air with Retina display (2018) and later models allow for battery replacement with a stretch-release adhesive, improving repairability.\n- iPad mini (6th generation) and iPad Air (5th generation) support same-unit battery replacement in select locations.\n\n• We've expanded the availability of repair parts to support older products for up to seven years in countries around the world. For example, a program for Mac laptops makes battery repair available for up to 10 years after a product was last distributed, subject to parts availability.\n\nFor more information, refer to the [Apple Support page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624) about the availability of service parts and repairs.\n\n",

We provide or participate in product take-back and recycling collection programs in 99 percent of the countries where we sell products. Our customers can trade in devices for reuse or recycling at retail locations and through recycling programs offered by local operators around the world. They also have the option to do so online through programs like Apple Trade In.\n\nIn 2023, we directed nearly 40,000 metric tons of electronic scrap globally to recycling facilities with the help of customer and employee programs.\n\nWe work with best-in-class recyclers to maximize the potential of the recycling materials stream and drive our efforts to close the loop on key materials. We define best-in-class recyclers as those capable of recovering materials at high rates and doing so with better environmental and safety performance. We verify recyclers' compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Responsibility Standards through third-party assessments. In addition, we look for our recyclers to maintain regional leading certifications, such as WEEELABEX, e-Stewards®, or R2. We assess our recyclers regularly for compliance with standards, regulations, and best practices in the areas of labor and human rights; security; and environment, health, and safety (EHS). In 2023, we conducted 91 recycler assessments. We've increasingly sought out specialty providers capable of handling specific material streams to enhance the quantity and quality of materials. This global footprint of recyclers also helps us build a more resilient recycling supply chain and innovate with more suppliers around the world.\n\nEducation and training can help us improve recovery rates for our products. We've invested deeply in this because it provides recyclers with the information they need to improve efficiency, quality, and capacity. We work with recyclers to continue devising new recycling solutions that can be shared through training and ongoing support. We help these partners develop the ability to disassemble our products and recover as much material as possible while minimizing waste.\n\nWe continue to expand our [Apple Recycler Guides](https://www.apple.com/recycling/recycler-guides/) to provide up-to-date recycling guidance across our products. Our engineering teams develop these guides to help professional recyclers optimize recovery and complete the processes using the tools and procedures available to them. The guides provide valuable insight into the recycling process, including recommendations for directing disassembled parts to downstream facilities for resource recovery. We're increasing the market availability of highquality recycled content by improving material recovery rates.\n\nThrough the Apple Education Hub, part of our Supplier Employee Development Fund, we've also supported our U.S. recyclers in their efforts to improve recycling capacity, quality, and efficiency with a lean manufacturing educational program. Embracing lean methodologies and management systems can bolster employee engagement, mitigate safety issues, and improve recycling economics. Read more about these programs in our [People](http://www.supplychainreports.apple/Apple-Supply-Chain-2024-Progress-Report)  [and Environment in Our Supply Chain 2024 Annual](http://www.supplychainreports.apple/Apple-Supply-Chain-2024-Progress-Report)  [Progress](http://www.supplychainreports.apple/Apple-Supply-Chain-2024-Progress-Report) Report.\n\nWe're also continuing our partnership with Atea a leading provider of IT infrastructure solutions in the Nordic and Baltic regions — to collect end-of-life iPhone devices for recycling with our Daisy robot in the Netherlands. We encourage our customers around the world to return end-of-life devices to Apple so that materials can be reintroduced to the circular economy.

We continue to develop better, more efficient means of disassembling products that maximize material recovery while minimizing waste. Our Material Recovery Lab (MRL), an R2-certified facility in Austin, Texas, focuses on assessing the recyclability of our products, helping inform design decisions that support disassembly and recovery. The MRL's work has led the way in automated approaches to material recovery with our robots Daisy, Dave, and Taz.\n\nWe're also developing new technologies at our R2-certified asset recovery center in Santa Clara Valley, California, that uses automation and machine learning to facilitate recycling processes that typically require manual sorting, which can be time intensive and error prone. In 2023, we deployed autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) to transport materials across our operations, as well as an automated product sorter that uses machine learning to identify and sort our products into 17 categories. These technologies improve material handling and sorting efficiency, which has a direct impact on the material capacity of our operations. This work aims to create low-cost solutions that our suppliers can deploy to recover more materials, freeing up their employees for more complex tasks that can't be easily automated.\n\nWe're also working to improve the material handling efforts of demanufacturing. Last year, we began deploying overhead projector–based augmented reality systems to recyclers, which project instructions for demanufacturing processes onto the work surface. These systems are designed to further improve safety, productivity, and efficiency.\n\n",

For several years, we've worked with Carnegie Mellon University's Biorobotics Lab in the School of Computer Science's Robotics Institute to identify and disassemble e-scrap. This project has the potential to enable recyclers to recover the materials at a higher quality. The software we develop will be open source and available to others in the industry who are working to maximize the recovery of recyclable materials.

We then design solutions to manage the quality of the wastewater that we return to the watershed.\n\nIn our corporate operations, we discharge the majority of our wastewater to the sanitary sewer. Up to 54 percent of the water that we use at our corporate locations is discharged back into the local water system rather than consumed[.71](#page-112-0) We monitor the water quality from sites where we have an industrial wastewater discharge so that each location meets or exceeds local discharge requirements.\n\nAt our Capstone campus in Austin, Texas, we aim to achieve net-zero water use by relying on an onsite wastewater reuse system, as well as condensate recovery and stormwater capture, limiting potable water use to potable purposes only. This effort\n\nwill save up to 60 million gallons of freshwater use annually[.72](#page-112-0) Using wastewater for cooling will also allow us to achieve 28 million kilowatt-hour in energy savings annually at the location.

For example, in 2023 we continued an initiative that focuses on eradicating potential hazards associated with liquid discharge throughout our manufacturing supply chain. The purpose of the initiative is to enhance and support our electrochemical metal-finishing processes, like anodizing. This effort incorporates cuttingedge technologies, including optimal water management, modular filtration and recovery units, acid recovery systems, and evaporators.

The program salvaged more than 100 metric tons of material, yielding over 50 metric tons of both ceiling tile and sheetrock, over 40 metric tons of carpet tile, and over 6 metric tons of glass to reuse the materials in new products.\n\n**Reusable Air Filters:** In 2023, we fully switched to reusable air filters to reduce waste sources — like packaging materials and commonly used equipment. Previously, no off-the-shelf reusable air filters were available for our application. In 2019, we partnered with an industry-leading automotive filtration and technology company to design a sustainable solution that met very specific design criteria for our design centers. And to date more than 58,000 reusable high-performance air filters — which are also available for other companies to use — have been placed in Apple-managed facilities worldwide. By replacing disposable air filters with reusable ones, we avoid landfilling 25 tons of dirty filters each year. Further, the reusable air filters are more energy efficient, leading to 35 percent savings in fan energy use.\n\n**Managing hazardous waste:**We remain committed to safely and responsibly managing hazardous waste. To make sure that wastes are treated, recycled, or incinerated according to safety and environmental standards in the U.S., Apple performs audits of treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs), with seven performed in 2023. We continually reevaluate the facilities that dispose of and manage hazardous and regulated wastes, working to assess disposal methods, availability, economics, and sustainability.\n\n",

Apple employees, suppliers, recyclers, and waste solution providers are central to achieving this goal. Since we launched the Zero Waste Program for our manufacturing partners in 2015, we've continued to make considerable progress. And we've expanded this program to include more than 350 supplier facilities across 13 countries and regions.\n\nWe require our suppliers to take part in our Zero Waste Program as part of our Supplier Code of Conduct. Suppliers must implement a systematic approach for identifying all waste sources and characterizing each stream in the waste inventory, developing a program or solution to quantify and monitor their waste-to-landfill diversion rate, setting waste minimization goals, and maintaining progress toward achieving zero waste to landfill. Our Zero Waste Program provides training and tools to help suppliers track their waste, set waste minimization goals, and create improvement plans for achieving zero waste in their operations.\n\nIn 2023, the Supplier Zero Waste Implementation Plan became part of our assessment requirement, following a year of training and piloting. Now all our key manufacturing suppliers must implement the Zero Waste Program, which includes evaluating their performance against the program's criteria.\n\nAs part of the Supplier Code of Conduct requirement, we also require more than 1,000 supplier production facilities to report waste inventory to Apple annually. Facilities have received trainings and templates to record and correctly classify waste data and document the visible diversion rate. To verify the waste data quality, we partnered with third-party auditors to conduct sample evaluations, which focused on waste classifications, waste data recordkeeping and reporting, and reasonable waste treatment methods.\n\nWe provide all facilities participating in the program with resources and guidance on how to reduce waste and reuse, recycle, or compost waste. Suppliers at these locations can also access tools to improve waste management and, in some cases, onsite support. The program is making an impact: In 2023, suppliers redirected more than 497,000 metric tons of waste from landfills, bringing the total to 3 million metric tons since the program's inception — equivalent to eliminating 3.7 million square meters of landfill space. Throughout 2023, 100 percent of established final assembly sites maintained zero-waste-to-landfill operations.[83](#page-112-0)\n\nAnd we're working on the next challenge in achieving zero waste, which is a level deeper into the subassembly module suppliers who assemble the individual components of Apple products. The waste stream at this level is often more complex than at final assembly sites, but we're making progress. As of 2023, more than 300 module suppliers\n\nhave participated in Zero Waste Program since its inception — including those who provide core technology components, displays, PCB and flex, packaging and enclosures. They've diverted more than 352,000 metric tons of waste from landfills.\n\n",

We also pursue material solutions to impact the waste streams coming into these facilities to simplify and maximize the recyclable content that our suppliers work with.\n\nPlastics comprise one of the major waste streams in our supply chain. For this reason, we've focused our efforts on reducing the amount of plastic waste generated during manufacturing. In 2018, we partnered with a key material vendor to develop components that have helped our suppliers reduce waste. These include recyclable protective films (RPFs) that safeguard products during manufacturing and reusable trays used to securely deliver modules through assembly sites.\n\nWe're also working to reduce more complex waste streams, including processing chemical waste found further upstream in our supply chain. One typical process waste is coolant, a chemical material used to cool the surface of machinery involved in manufacturing components like enclosures. To avoid sending coolant waste to landfill or an incinerator, we launched a series of coolant reduction initiatives\n\nImage /page/53/Picture/14 description: {\n\"image\\_description\": \"A storage area featuring vertically stacked black and red racks extending along a concrete walkway.\"\n}\n\nIn 2023, we fully switched to reusable air filters to reduce waste sources — like packaging materials and commonly used equipment.\n\n<span id=\"page-54-0\"></span>in our enclosure supply chain. We focused on reducing coolant usage by implementing minimum quantity lubricant (MQL) technology, an ultraviolet or ozone approach to recycling coolant, and end-of-life recycling. These initiatives have reduced more than 20,000 metric tons of coolant-containing waste in the past year.\n\n",

        "text": "#### **Engaging with suppliers to reduce waste**\n\nWe work closely with our suppliers to realize our zero-waste goals. This work faces a range of challenges, including a lack of access to recycling technologies, the absence of local infrastructure, and the lower value of recyclable material that impacts the economics of recycling.\n\nIn 2023, we focused on reducing a significant portion of plastics in manufacturing and transportation of our products. With packaging, we've already made significant progress in transitioning to fiber-based materials. We're now working to extend that success to the packaging module components used by our suppliers during transportation and at assembly sites. Our suppliers have developed fiber alternatives to replace plastic films, foams, and bags. The initial pilot, launched in 2022, focused on reducing waste associated with iPad; the program now includes iPhone, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods. Since this effort began, our suppliers have saved 3,600 metric tons in plastic used while manufacturing and transporting our products.\n\nThe Waste to Resource database we designed provides access to available technologies and local recyclers that we've recommended by the suppliers we work with. The database includes information on more than 1,500 resources across more than 250 cities in China, Thailand, India, and Vietnam — a number that grows as we and our suppliers share valuable resources through the database. As more of our suppliers achieve their zero-waste goals, we're able to learn and share more information. We plan to make this resource public for the benefit of the entire electronics industry.\n\nOne example of a resource benefiting the industry is a tool developed by Apple and UL Solutions, our partner that validates zero-waste efforts. The tool provides the first-ever supply chain zero-waste management system assurance program, enabling third-party zero-waste verification at a systems level rather than at a site level. The assurance procedure has allowed us to accelerate the verification process significantly and establishes a new model that companies across industries can employ to verify zero-waste programs at scale. This streamlined approach has brought even more suppliers into our program, with more than 185 facilities assured in 2023 by UL Solutions — 35 more than the previous year[.84](#page-112-0)\n\nWe also provide support for our suppliers in verifying their zero-waste efforts. Since launch, the foundation of our Zero Waste Program has followed the UL 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill Environmental Claim Validation Procedure (ECVP), which requires at least 90 percent\n\ndiversion through methods other than waste-toenergy. Through this standard, our supplier facilities can certify against clear benchmarks for waste diversion, including Platinum, Gold, and Silver levels of verification. We've spent the last seven years expanding this program throughout our supply chain, with suppliers in China, India, and Vietnam becoming UL validated. Since we switched from individual site verification to system-level verification, suppliers participating in the assurance program can easily apply their verification statements from UL.\n\n",

This has been implemented widely and used by suppliers in the Zero Waste Program. Suppliers have also received access to training and coaching on waste classification to support their efforts in separating waste while promoting waste reduction, reuse, and recycling.\n\nThe data we've aggregated summarizes the top 10 waste streams — including plastics, papers, and metals — and their corresponding diversion solutions. This provides a valuable perspective on the waste footprint across our supply chain; it also shows us where we can expend our efforts on material utilization to reduce the amount of waste sent to incineration or landfill.\n\nStarting in 2022, Apple organized a series of webinars with suppliers, policymakers, and industrial leaders to share their experiences in the Zero Waste Program with participating suppliers and those who plan to join. These sessions provide an opportunity to discuss lessons learned implementing the Zero Waste Program, best practices around the compliance requirements of waste management, and emerging recycling and reduction technologies.\n\nWe're focused on expanding the impact of the Zero Waste Program in our supply chain and beyond. In 2023, we launched a zero-waste education initiative in India. Supported by our Supplier Employee Development Fund, we've been able to design a series of zero-waste-related trainings specific to India for supplier leadership, employees, and members of local communities.\n\nWe've offered several learning programs in India that cover sustainability basics, the roadmap for achieving zero waste, and best practices in waste management. These include supplier classroom sessions in Bangalore and Chennai focused on leadership capabilities and training to help scale the Zero Waste Program, as well as community e-learning resources to introduce sustainable living, domestic composting, and basic waste management beyond the workplace that can benefit everyone.\n\n",

As of 2023, 108 of our corporate offices, data centers, retail stores across the world, totaling more than 18 million square feet of green building space, are Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) or Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) certified.\n\nOur global footprint requires that we adapt to the needs of different locations and climates while pursuing our overall objectives. In 2023, two Apple sites in Israel and Spain earned LEED Gold certification and one location achieved Platinum certification — our first in Southern California to do so. A building on our Culver City campus demonstrated reductions of more than 45 percent reduction in indoor water use and more than 15 percent in energy use. For construction and demolition waste, the site diverted more than 75 percent of materials. The location was also recognized for its ease of commuting, including its proximity to seven public transit lines, the availability of bike racks and showers for employees who cycle to work.\n\nWe bring a similar environmental approach to our retail store development. In Mumbai, India, we opened Apple BKC — our first retail location in the nation — which earned LEED Platinum certification. The store's energy-efficient design, use of natural light, and onsite photovoltaic panels helped achieve energy savings of more than 40 percent, and its low-flow fixtures and onsite\n\ngray water recycling reduced water consumption by more than 84 percent. The site also diverted 95 percent of the construction waste from landfill while using sustainably harvested wood for the ceiling, furniture, and fixtures. The success of these efforts resulted from a strong partnership with our local landlord partner who shared our values and priorities, ensuring that our collective environmental objectives were achieved.\n\nOur new Apple Battersea retail location in the historic Battersea Power Station in London is trending to achieve a BREEAM Very Good rating. The build-out of the store and offices resulted in a 99 percent rate of diversion for construction waste. The retail store project uses our newest and most sustainable design language and materials, which heavily focuses on low-carbon design elements including a biopolymer terrazzo floor, sustainably harvested wood, reduced steel tonnage, and an acoustic baffle ceiling.\n\nEach Apple building needs to coexist with its environment while meeting our standards for human-centric design. We work hard to strike this balance and harness the creativity and innovation that these challenges demand.\n\nImage /page/55/Picture/10 description: {\n\"image\\_description\": \"This image depicts the opening event of an Apple Store, named Apple BKC, with the surrounding showing a lively crowd and excited staff wearing green shirts.

We identify chemicals that balance our priorities including safety and performance — minimizing our environmental impact. The program supports the steps we're taking toward a circular supply chain by reducing the recirculation of potentially harmful substances, and it contributes to a healthier workplace for our manufacturers and suppliers.\n\nWe focus on limiting chemical exposure through the commonly used hierarchy of controls. The concept consists of five actions that organizations can take with materials:\n\n- Elimination\n- Substitution\n- Engineering controls\n- Administrative controls\n- Personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\nWe prioritize elimination and substitution, and when no alternative is available to eliminate or substitute potential exposure, we rely on engineering and administrative controls to safeguard against hazard exposure.\n\nOur program involves establishing safety requirements that often exceed local industry standards and supporting our suppliers. We've created standards and programs to support these efforts, including the rigorous requirements defined in our [Regulated](https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Regulated_Substances_Specification.pdf)  [Substances Specification \\(RSS](https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Regulated_Substances_Specification.pdf)) and the deep supply chain engagement through our Full Material Disclosure (FMD) and Chemical Safety Disclosure (CSD) programs.\n\nMaintaining comprehensive information on the chemicals and materials we use is essential.

Through the CSD program, suppliers are required to provide this data as part of a rigorous disclosure process. With a detailed chemical inventory from our suppliers, we can support our supply chain partners in identifying risks and opportunities to implement safer alternatives.\n\nIn 2023, more than 1000 supplier facilities shared their chemical inventories as well as their storage and control information through the CSD program, including suppliers representing the majority of Apple's direct spend. And through this program, we've identified more than 17,000 unique materials and chemicals used in the manufacturing process. All these efforts contribute to a safer work environment for people across our supply chain.\n\n**COMPREHENSIVE CHEMICAL MAPPING FOR SAFER PRODUCTS**\n\n",

The specification builds on our history of advancements in material safety — and it reflects our dedication to the collection of necessary data to uphold these requirements.\n\nWe continue to evolve the RSS with new chemicals and restrictions based on the latest scientific research and standards, drawing from regulations, international standards, and voluntary requirements. Many of the specification's restrictions exceed the most stringent local regulatory requirements in order to protect workers health and the environment. The specification designates restricted substances and requires reporting on additional substances. We've updated and expanded chemical restrictions that, in many instances, surpass current regulatory restrictions. Most recently, we've added perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxA) — a subset of the larger group of PFAS — phenol, isopropylated, phosphate (3:1) (PIP 3:1), and several skin-sensitizing substances well ahead of regulatory restrictions.\n\nOur Green Chemistry Advisory Board provides feedback on key initiatives, including potential updates to the RSS. The advisory board is an independent group of leading researchers and academics. Their diverse experience and perspectives help us lead the way in protecting our customers and those who make or recycle our products.\n\nWe apply controls to materials that come into prolonged skin contact (as defined in our [Restricted](https://www.apple.com/support/assets/docs/products/watch/Restricted_Chemicals_for_Wearables.pdf)  [Chemicals for Prolonged Skin Contact Materials](https://www.apple.com/support/assets/docs/products/watch/Restricted_Chemicals_for_Wearables.pdf) list). The restrictions focus on substances that are potential skin sensitizers to minimize the potential for reactions commonly reported across wearable products, like jewelry. We derive these restrictions from leading standards, recommendations from toxicologists and dermatologists, international laws and directives, and Apple policies. We mandate that our suppliers analyze each material that comes into prolonged contact with skin according to Apple's requirements, and we review compliance with these requirements. Our specifications are incorporated into contractual obligations for our suppliers, and each one helps us maintain our stringent requirements.\n\n",

Regulators and environmental health and safety organizations have focused considerable attention on the chemistries of cleaners and degreasers. We're investing in the due diligence required to identify preferred alternatives for suppliers and others in the industry to use.\n\nWe've eliminated the use of cleaners with known carcinogens, mutagens, reproductive toxicants, strong sensitizers and persistent bio-accumulative toxins (including PFAS) from cleaners and degreasers used at our supplier final assembly sites. We did this by using globally recognized standards (such as EPA Safer Choice, GreenScreen Certified® and ToxFMD®)\n\nbased on chemical hazard assessments, because this is a more comprehensive and robust hazard approach than simply eliminating individual substances of concern. In 2023, we approved additional safer cleaners for use in our supply chain, bringing the total number of safer cleaners we've approved over the past three years to 175.\n\nOur efforts have had a direct impact on health and safety — and they have the potential to change how our industry operates. By making it easier for suppliers to select safer alternatives for process chemicals at the outset, we're promoting their use across our supply chain. All our final assembly sites have used only safer alternative cleaners and degreasers, as defined by Apple, since 2018. We've since expanded this work deeper into our supply chain to suppliers and processes beyond final assembly, helping them identify and implement opportunities to use safer alternatives in their operations. In 2023, we received, for the third time in four years, the EPA Safer Choice Partner of the Year Award for our work to scale the use of safer process chemicals and to protect those who work in our supply chain.\n\nWe're also looking outside our own supply chain to promote a broader transition to safer chemicals.

We're lending our expertise on safer chemistries to support our suppliers as they meet the growing demand for safer materials. Prioritizing these materials also means phasing out chemistries that don't meet our specifications. We've approached this across our company and products while investing in safer alternatives to drive change across our industry. The use of safer cleaners today supports the circular supply chains of the future.\n\nUsing our research and analysis of materials, we've collaborated with suppliers to create safer alternatives — including for substances where none currently exist. In those cases, we lend our technical capabilities in material science to work with suppliers to develop entirely new chemistries. We maintain the same high safety, performance, and environmental standards for new alternative materials, submitting them through rigorous testing and evaluation to avoid regrettable substitutions.\n\nWe've led in the identification and successful removal of potentially harmful substances since the late 1990s. This process has involved rigorously assessing chemicals and removing those that don't align with our goals — in some cases, before removal becomes a requirement and industry standard. We're committed to phasing out our use of PFAS and engaging with all our supply chain partners to restrict PFAS from our products and manufacturing processes.\n\nWhile our analysis indicates that PFAS used in our products are safe during product use, we felt it was important to broaden our scope to consider manufacturing along the supply chain. We're prioritizing our phaseout activities in applications that result in the highest volumes of PFAS reductions and the most meaningful environmental impact. We're pursuing our phaseout in three steps: compiling a comprehensive catalog of PFAS uses in our products, identifying and developing non-PFAS alternatives that can meet our performance needs, and confirming that non-PFAS alternatives align with our safety and environmental goals. We have created new formulations of plastics, adhesives and lubricants with PFAS replaced by other existing technologies in order to achieve similar performance in flame resistance and friction reduction.\n\n",

Identifying and promoting the use of safer cleaners beyond Apple is a way to increase the impact of safer alternatives. The criteria we set for chemicals in materials — and how our suppliers use them — help establish even more stringent standards around health and safety across the electronics industry. We collaborate with standards-setting bodies, trade associations, and NGOs to achieve this — developing tools, standards, and mechanisms to drive the identification and adoption of smarter chemistries throughout our supply chain.\n\nWe've focused on cleaners and degreasers, building out multiple pathways to advance industry innovation in safer cleaners. For the past five years, our final assembly sites have exclusively used safer cleaners and degreasers, as identified by Apple or as certified by third-party programs. This work has expanded to component manufacturers who create modules used in the final assembly of our products. Our\n\nefforts to use safer cleaners in our supply chain have been central to our advocacy for greater industry collaboration and instrumental to our participation as a founding signatory of the Toward Zero Exposure program led by the Clean Electronics Production Network (CEPN). For more information about Apple's participation in CEPN, read our [People and](http://www.supplychainreports.apple/Apple-Supply-Chain-2024-Progress-Report)  [Environment in Our Supply Chain 2024 Annual](http://www.supplychainreports.apple/Apple-Supply-Chain-2024-Progress-Report)  [Progress](http://www.supplychainreports.apple/Apple-Supply-Chain-2024-Progress-Report) Report.\n\nWe collaborated with IPC, a globally recognized electronics standards-setting body, to draft and help launch IPC-1402, Standard for Green Cleaners Used in Electronics Manufacturing. This standard resulted from work over the past three years with the Green Cleaners for Electronics Manufacturing task group, where Apple has served as a chair working with more than 20 industry partners. This new standard will help suppliers across the electronics industry select cleaners that are safer for workers and the environment. In 2022, Apple received the IPC Stan Plzak Corporate Recognition Award for our work on this effort and our contributions to the industry.We continued to partner with ChemFORWARD, a nonprofit organization committed to creating broad\n\naccess to chemical hazard data to make it easier for suppliers to choose safer alternatives. In 2023, we worked with ChemFORWARD to announce a new open resource called ChemWorks that aims to help others identify certified safer formulations to accelerate the adoption of safer cleaners and degreasers as we have in our own supply chain.\n\nWe also supported the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) in producing a comprehensive technical guide on responsible chemical management, as well as more than 20 hours of related training content to educate workers across many companies about controlling occupational exposures to hazardous chemicals.\n\n",

The communities that we engage with help shape how we evaluate global and regional regulations, approaches, and the promise of emerging technologies. As we implement what we've learned, we incorporate feedback on our progress — including aligning with new standards and best practices or exploring the potential impact that cutting-edge research can have on our operations.\n\nWe consult with the scientific community to better understand emerging approaches, technologies, and tools that can support our environmental goals. To enhance material recovery for Apple and others, we worked with Carnegie Mellon University researchers to create robotic recycling systems that have advanced product disassembly and material\n\nsorting mechanisms. We also continue our Green Chemistry Advisory Board, an independent group of experts in green chemistry, green engineering, and toxicology who advise on our Smarter Chemistry initiatives, including updates to the RSS.\n\nWe draw from cross-sector engagement platforms like the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) to help guide our programs and set standards for environmental efforts. The expertise of AWS defines the world-class water stewardship practices that we've implemented at key Apple and supplier facilities, earning AWS Standard certification.\n\nThe business community — including our customers, suppliers, industry partners, and investors — is also a source of valuable collaboration. As co-chair of the United States Information Technology Office (USITO) — a trade association representing the U.S. information and communications technology industry in China — we lead the environmental protection and energy efficiency working groups.

Within those programs, we build the networks and systems required to maintain a continued engagement process with our suppliers.\n\nSome of our programs — such as the Supplier Code of Conduct, the Supplier Clean Energy Program, and the Supplier Clean Water Program — are models for how we communicate supplier performance expectations and track progress. Through these programs, we're setting a high standard for factories, helping facilitate efforts to decarbonize operations across our supply chain, driving water reuse across sites, establishing protocols to responsibly use resources in manufacturing operations, and more.\n\nWe also encourage our suppliers to participate in market and policy developments that help advance responsible and sustainable supply chains. Additionally, providing resources to our suppliers makes up a critical component of our engagement work. We've offered trainings, workshops, educational materials, webinars, and connections to external funding and support throughout the breadth of our supplier responsibility programs.\n\nTo learn more about our work with our suppliers, see our [People and Environment in Our Supply Chain](http://www.supplychainreports.apple/Apple-Supply-Chain-2024-Progress-Report)  [2024 Annual Progress](http://www.supplychainreports.apple/Apple-Supply-Chain-2024-Progress-Report) Report.\n\n",

The work we do with others yields tangible outcomes across our environmental goals — and it encourages broader action.\n\nAn example of these collaborative efforts is our participation in RE100 — an energy initiative aimed at scaling zero-carbon grids. RE100 unites the world's most influential businesses committed to transitioning their entire electricity use to renewables.\n\nWe're also a founding member of the First Movers Coalition (FMC). This global initiative harnesses companies' purchasing power to decarbonize seven hard-to-abate industrial sectors — which currently account for 30 percent of global emissions according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). Through this initiative, we've committed to moving to sustainable aviation fuel for 5 percent of our passenger air travel footprint; to procuring at least\n\n10 percent of annual primary aluminum at or above the FMC's definition of \"near-zero emissions primary aluminum\"; and to ensuring that at least 50 percent of all aluminum procured annually is sourced from secondary aluminum by 2030. We're also supporting investments in forestry and carbon removal through external initiatives like the Forest Investor Club and our own Restore Fund (see [page](#page-34-0) 35).\n\nThrough the Exponential Roadmap Initiative, we're strengthening our work to transitioning our supply chain to 100 percent renewables, on moving towards full circularity by improving materials and low-carbon design, and on transforming our portfolio towards climate solutions.\n\nAs part of the Toward Zero Exposure program with the Clean Electronics Production Network (CEPN), we're working to address health and safety challenges in the electronics supply chain with other stakeholders. We made our pledge to shift to 100 percent fiber-based packaging by 2025 with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

We do not currently account for these emissions in our carbon footprint, due to the poor quality of this data.\n- 5 Beginning in fiscal year 2021, we're accounting for scope 2 emissions from the purchase of district heating, chilled water, and steam.\n- 6 Beginning in fiscal year 2020, we updated our methodology for calculating emissions from employee commute to reflect employees working from home during COVID-19.\n- 7 For a detailed breakdown of carbon offset purchases applied to our corporate footprint, see the carbon offsets table on the following page.\n\n- 8 We retired 324,100 metric tons of carbon credits from the [Alto Mayo project](http://registry.verra.org/app/projectDetail/VCS/944) in Peru and [Chyulu Hills project](https://registry.verra.org/app/projectDetail/VCS/1408) in Kenya to maintain carbon neutrality for our corporate emissions in fiscal year 2022. This project is certified to the VCS and CCB standards.\n- 9 We retired 167,000 metric tons of carbon credits from the [Chyulu Hills project](https://registry.verra.org/app/projectDetail/VCS/1408) in Kenya to maintain carbon neutrality for our corporate emissions in fiscal year 2021. This project is certified to the VCS and CCB standards.\n- 10 We retired 70,000 metrics tons of carbon credits — 53,000 from the [Chyulu Hills project](https://registry.verra.org/app/projectDetail/VCS/1408) in Kenya and 17,000 from the [Cispatá Mangrove project](https://registry.verra.org/app/projectDetail/VCS/2290)  in [Colombia.](https://registry.verra.org/app/projectDetail/VCS/2290)\n- 11 Because we're committed to accuracy and transparency, we regularly refine our product life cycle assessment model and sources of data. For example, last year we obtained more granular data summarizing in which countries our products are sold and used, resulting in more granularity possible for grid emission factors used in the carbon footprint of the product use phase. The net result was an increase in our fiscal year 2021 carbon footprint. When using the same level of data granularity and model as fiscal year 2021, our product use greenhouse gas emissions in fiscal year 2021 would have been about 2.5 percent lower.\n- 12 For fiscal year 2021, we retired credits from the [Chyulu Hills project](https://registry.verra.org/app/projectDetail/VCS/1408) in Kenya and purchased carbon credits from two additional projects to offset a total of 500,000 metric tons of direct emissions across our value chain. The [first project,](https://registry.verra.org/app/projectDetail/VCS/1622) a REDD+ coastal conservation project in Guatemala, protects and conserves forests from deforestation and degradation. The [second project](https://registry.verra.org/app/projectDetail/VCS/2070) aims to establish forests on about 46,000 hectares of barren land that isn't otherwise in use across seven counties in the Guizhou province of China. Both projects are certified to the same high standards that we require for projects in the Restore Fund, including VCS and CCB standards.\n- 13 Due to rounding, our gross and net carbon footprints do not always equal the sum of the subtotals disclosed above.\n\n",

district heating, chilled water, and steam.\n- 2 Because energy efficiency measures have lasting benefits, energy efficiency savings are calculated cumulatively since 2012. All efficiency measures are retired based on their effective useful lifetime as documented by the California Energy Commission. In 2023, we accounted for our expired corporate energy efficiency savings and reflected these changes for fiscal years 2019 through 2023. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, corporate facilities' energy use declined temporarily as we adjusted lighting and climate controls due to shutdowns and reduced occupancy. These savings are not included in the total savings from our energy efficiency program initiatives. We also recognize that energy use at our employees' homes likely increased during this period. We have not accounted for this energy use because we anticipated this impact is small relative to our overall energy use and we're still evolving our methodology.\n- 3 Energy savings from supplier energy efficiency improvements are reported as annualized numbers. Beginning in 2020, supplier energy savings are calculated based on the fiscal year instead of on a calendar-year basis.\n- 4 Beginning January 1, 2018, 100 percent of the electricity we use to power our global facilities is sourced from renewable energy.\n- 5 Supply chain renewable electricity capacity (operational) and renewable electricity use for fiscal year 2021 do not include REC purchases Apple made, equivalent to 0.3 GW and 500,000 MWh, respectively, to address a small increase to its carbon footprint.\n\n",

The majority of our freshwater comes from municipal sources, and less than 5 percent comes from onsite groundwater sources.\n- 2 Recycled water represents a key alternative water source. Our recycled water is sourced primarily from municipal treatment plants, with less than 5 percent coming from onsite treatment. Recycled water is primarily used for irrigation, makeup water in cooling, and toilet flushing.\n- 3 Other alternative sources of water include rainwater and recovered condensate captured onsite. Water used for construction activities like dust control is not included in this total and represents 13 million gallons of water used in fiscal year 2021. Beginning with our fiscal year 2023 water footprint, we began allocating our Prineville data center water use, which comes from an Aquifer Storage and Recovery system, to alternative sources to better represent the impact of our water use.\n- 4 Beginning in fiscal year 2022, we expanded our packaging goal boundary to better reflect our impact to include retail bags, all finished goods boxes (including plastic content in labels and in-box documentation), packaging sent to our customers as part of Apple Trade In, AppleCare packaging for whole units and service modules (with the exception of plastics needed to protect items from electrostatic discharge), and secondary packaging of Apple products and accessories sold by Apple. Our goal boundary does not include the inks, coatings, or adhesives used in our packaging In addition to our packaging footprint.\n- 5 Responsible sourcing of wood fiber is defined in Apple's Sustainable Fiber Specification. Since 2017, all the virgin wood fiber used in our packaging has come from responsible sources.\n\n",

We used a 1978 federal law called the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) to structure the project. We then applied this same structure to two more large solar PV and biogas fuel cell projects in North Carolina and two microhydro projects in Oregon.

The onsite generation comes from 14 megawatts of rooftop solar PV and 4 megawatts of baseload biogas fuel cells. Any additional energy required is drawn by Direct Access from the California Flats solar project in nearby Monterey County. The microgrid system with battery storage manages the renewable energy generation and the building's energy use; optimizes demand management, load shifting, and frequency regulation services; and ensures uninterrupted energy reliability against local grid outages.\n\nFacilities renewable energy projects To reach 100 percent renewable electricity for Apple's own facilities, Apple has helped create 1,647 MW of renewable energy around the world. The projects listed to the right represent Apple-created renewable energy projects that support Apple facilities' electricity use and contribute to cleaner grids around the world. Operational projects apply a mix of renewable energy technology, including wind (22 percent), solar (78 percent), microhydro (0.2 percent), and biogas fuel cells (0.2 percent).\n\nThis table represents all operational renewable energy projects that Apple has helped create.\n\n| Location                  | Renewable energy technology | Size (MW) |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------|\n| Australia                 | PV                          | 0.5       |\n| Brazil                    | Wind                        | 0.5       |\n| China mainland            | PV                          | 195       |\n| Denmark                   | PV                          | 42        |\n| Denmark                   | Wind                        | 17        |\n| India                     | PV                          | 16        |\n| Israel                    | PV                          | 5         |\n| Japan                     | PV                          | 12        |\n| Mexico                    | Wind                        | 0.8       |\n| Power for Impact projects | PV                          | 1.2       |\n| Rooftop solar projects    | PV                          | 5         |\n| Singapore                 | PV                          | 54        |\n| Taiwan                    | PV                          | 1         |\n| Türkiye                   | PV                          | 4         |\n| Arizona, U.S.             | PV                          | 62        |\n| California, U.S.          | Biogas fuel cell            | 4         |\n| California, U.S.          | PV                          | 144       |\n| Illinois, U.S.            | Wind                        | 112       |\n| Nevada, U.S.              | PV                          | 320       |\n| North Carolina, U.S.      | PV                          | 164       |\n| Oregon, U.S.              | Microhydro                  | 3         |\n| Oregon, U.S.              | PV                          | 125       |\n| Oregon, U.S.              | Wind                        | 200       |\n| Texas, U.S.               | Wind                        | 25        |\n| Virginia, U.S.            | PV                          | 134       |\n| Total                     |                             | 1647      |\n\nNote: Data current as of February 2024 (operational).\n\n",

To cover our needs, we build our own renewable power projects and work with utilities to purchase clean energy from locally obtained resources. We're staying at 100 percent even as Apple's data center presence continues to grow.\n\nWe now operate seven data centers, and more are being developed.2 These data centers are spread across North America, Europe, and Asia.

We then worked with the local utility, Duke Energy, to help build five solar projects through its Green Source Rider program. These solar projects came online beginning in 2015 and were Duke Energy's first Green Source Rider projects to become operational. We worked with Duke Energy for several years to develop this green energy tariff option, which allowed Apple\n\nand Duke Energy to develop new renewable energy projects. The five Green Source Rider projects have a combined capacity of 22 megawatts. In 2017, we made long-term commitments to five more solar projects in North Carolina, for an additional 85 megawatts of renewable energy.\n\nThe energy efficiency measures we've implemented at our Maiden data centers include use of outside air cooling through a waterside economizer during night and cool-weather hours, which, along with water storage, allows the chillers to be idle 75 percent of the time.\n\n",

To supplement these projects, we executed a long-term purchase agreement for all environmental attributes from a 69-megawatt portfolio of eight solar projects in Oregon.\n\nOur Prineville data center takes advantage of the cool and dry climate by cooling its servers with outside air whenever possible.

In 2013, we created a partnership with the local utility, NV Energy, to develop the Fort Churchill Solar project. Apple designed, financed, and constructed the project. NV Energy owns and operates the facility and directs all the renewable energy it produces to our data center. The nearly 20-megawatt Fort Churchill Solar project was based on a unique tracker with curved mirrors that concentrate sunlight onto photovoltaic cells.\n\nTo facilitate further renewable development in Nevada, Apple worked with NV Energy and the Public Utility Commission of Nevada to create a green energy option open to all commercial customers, called the NV GreenEnergy Rider, that does not require the customer to fund project development up front. Thanks to this new option, in 2015 we announced our second Nevada solar project, the 50-megawatt Boulder Solar II project. This project came online in 2017. We've utilized the NV GreenEnergy Rider program to create two additional projects: the 200-megawatt Techren II solar project, online in 2019, and the 50-megawatt Turquoise Project, online in 2020.\n\nLike in Prineville, our Reno data center takes advantage of the mild climate by cooling its servers with outside air whenever possible. When the outside air is too warm to cool the servers alone, it draws from indirect evaporative cooling.\n\n- 4 Emissions avoided are calculated using the GHG Protocol methodology for calculating marketbased emissions.\n- 5 Emissions avoided are calculated using the GHG Protocol methodology for calculating marketbased emissions.\n\n",

This allows us to demonstrate the savings resulting from our renewable energy program.\n- 11 Apple's greenhouse gas emissions are calculated using the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology for calculating market-based emissions.\n- 12 We calculate our progress toward our 100 percent renewable energy goal on a calendar-year basis, while the numbers reported in this table are based on fiscal year. Beginning January 1, 2018, all the electricity use at our colocation facilities is from 100 percent renewable energy.\n- 13 Over the past few years, we've been installing submeters in colocation facilities to better track electricity usage. Beginning in fiscal year 2016, we started reporting this submetered electricity usage. Prior to fiscal year 2016, reported electricity usage was conservatively estimated based on maximum contract capacity quantities. We've updated our fiscal year 2016 colocation facilities footprint to more accurately reflect Apple's operational boundaries. Per the GHG Protocol, we've removed from our electricity usage and scope 2 calculations those emissions associated with colocation facility cooling and building operations.\n\n**2024 Environmental Progress Report 94**\n\n- **A: [Corporate facilities energy supplement](#page-84-0) B: Apple's life cycle assessment methodology C: [Assurance and review statements](#page-95-0)**\n- <span id=\"page-93-0\"></span>**D: [Environment, Health and Safety Policy](#page-106-0)**\n- **E: [ISO 14001 certification](#page-108-0) [Report notes](#page-110-0)**\n- **[End notes](#page-111-0)**\n\n",

The scope of the fiber and plastic packaging footprint includes Apple's corporate packaging fiber and plastic usage from products, retail operations and Apple care services.*(Continued summary text abridged for brevity in this example)*\n\n**2 - Reviewed Data and Findings**\n\nAs part of this review, Apple disclosed the following data to Fraunhofer IZM:\n\n- Calculation methodology for the corporate packaging fiber and plastic footprint\n- Sales data for FY2023, including accessories\n- Selected product and supplier specific data on packaging materials and production yields\n- Aggregated packaging fiber and plastic data for all products and the total corporate packaging fiber and plastic footprint for the fiscal year 2023\n\n*(Continued findings text abridged for brevity in this example)*\n\n| Based on the process and procedures conducted, there is no evidence that the corporate packaging fiber and plastic footprint is not materially correct and is not a fair representation of fiber and plastic data and information. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Berlin, March 11, 2024                                                                                                                                                                                                             | <span>- Marina Proske -<br/>Fraunhofer IZM<br/>Dept.

In addition, the bulk of Apple's recycled content data is certified and thus verified by a third party. Less than 5 percent of the total mass shipped in Apple products in fiscal year 2023 is recycled content data that is either supplier verified, meaning it has been reported\n\nby the supplier and cross-checked by Apple, or supplier reported, meaning it has been reported by the supplier based on production and allocation values. In all cases, Apple defines recycled content in alignment with ISO 14021. Product claims are made as of the launch date of those individual products, and they are accurate as of product launch.\n\n",

The GHG Protocol currently defines scope 1 emissions as direct greenhouse gas emissions that occur from sources that are owned or controlled by the company; scope 2 emissions as the indirect greenhouse gas emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heat, and cooling consumed by the company; and scope 3 emissions as all \"other indirect emissions\" that occur in the value chain of the reporting company, including both upstream and downstream emissions. Apple currently sets an operational boundary for its emissions and excludes the following scope 3 categories, as defined by the GHG Protocol, which collectively make up less than 10 percent of our 2015 base year scope 3 emissions currently: \"capital goods\" due to limited data availability, which limits our ability to influence these emissions, and \"waste generated in operations,\" as these emissions are negligible. The following subset of greenhouse gas categories recognized in the Kyoto Protocol are included: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).\n- [2](#page-3-0) Carbon reductions are calculated against a baseline scenario: 1) No use of clean electricity for manufacturing or product use, beyond what is already available on the grid (based on regional emissions factors). 2) Apple's carbon intensity of key materials as of 2015 (our baseline year for our 2030 product carbon neutrality goal). Carbon intensity of materials reflects use of recycled content and production technology. 3) Apple's average mix of transportation modes (air, rail, ocean, ground) by product line across three years (fiscal years 2017 to 2019) to best capture the baseline transportation emissions of our products.\n- [3](#page-3-0) As of product launch, 50 percent of all low-carbon watch products by weight are planned to be shipped via non-air modes of transportation over the lifetime of the products from our final assembly sites to their next destination — primarily regional distribution hubs.\n- [4](#page-3-0) Apple reports data about the recycled content of its products at different levels of fidelity, based on the level of independent data verification. The bulk of Apple's recycled content data is certified and thus verified by a third party. Less than 3 percent of the total mass shipped in Apple products in fiscal year 2023 contained recycled content that is either supplier verified, meaning it has been reported by the supplier and cross-checked by Apple, or supplier reported, meaning it has been reported by the supplier based on production and allocation values. In all cases, Apple defines recycled content in alignment with ISO 14021. We do not currently\n\ninclude industry-average recycled content, which may result in underreporting actual recycled content. Total recycled material shipped in products is driven by product material composition and total sales — as a result, this overall recycled or renewable content percentage may fluctuate based on the number and type of products sold each year.\n\n- [5](#page-3-0) All cobalt in the battery claims or references use mass balance allocation.\n- [6](#page-4-0) We plan to reach carbon neutrality beginning with our fiscal year 2030 carbon footprint.\n- [7](#page-4-0) In addition to working toward transitioning our entire product value chain to using 100 percent clean electricity by 2030, we're prioritizing energy efficiency and emissions reductions within supplier facilities and operations.\n- [8](#page-4-0) The Supplier Clean Energy Program has since been codified in the Supplier Code of Conduct, scaling the program to our entire direct manufacturing supply chain.\n- [9](#page-4-0) Refer to footnote 4.\n- [10](#page-4-0) By 2025, we plan to use 100 percent recycled cobalt in all Appledesigned batteries (using mass balance allocation), 100 percent recycled tin soldering and 100 percent recycled gold plating in all Apple-designed rigid and flexible printed circuit boards, and 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets.
